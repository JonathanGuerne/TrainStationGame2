          <h2>About the Game</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine this: you have a full day ahead of you with nothing planned
            <i>(Yes I know, bear with me)</i>. This game is the perfect solution for
            such a day <i>(if it really existed)</i>. What will you need?
            Ideally a daily pass for train
            <i
              >Yes it works also with a yearly pass, thanks for reminding me you
              got one...</i
            >
            The rest is quite simple for you, because you have nothing to do
            expect following the journey planned by the game from station to
            station.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>But how does it works?</b> Glad you asked! The game will look at
            your current location and find the closest train station. From there
            it will pick a departing train from the coming hour and a random
            station for you to disembark. Once you arrive at your destination,
            the game will repeat the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            How far away will you get? Will you end up in a city or in the
            middle of nowhere? <i>Will you end up in the town next door?</i> All
            bets are off at this point and that is the beauty of the game!
